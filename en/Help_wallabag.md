# Help Wallabag:
## Reporting Bugs
### Contact Wallabag Support

If you have a problem while installing or using Wallabag (either with the web application or the smartphone applications), use the support site [http://support.wallabag.org](http://support.wallabag.org).

We will try to help you promptly find a solution and address any new bugs that may be found.

It is better to use the support site than sending us an email: the followup is easier for us and the solution to your problem may help other users.

## Writing and fixing documentation

The documentation you are reading is likely to be missing features and issues, be out-of-date, or require a translation in your language. Take part in its writing and help improve Wallabag!

The Github repository can be found here: [https://github.com/wallabag/documentation](https://github.com/wallabag/documentation).

## Fixing Bugs

Bugs can be fixed via two paths:

* Via the [Support Site](http://support.wallabag.org):

	When a Wallabag user asks a new question you can answer them directly if you are a more advanced user.
* Via Github: 
 	
 	Some issues are able to be solved by yourself. [Go through the issue list](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/issues) and see if a pre-existing issue relates to you.

You are welcome to suggest changes to the Wallabag code which can then be considered and potentially merged. Look at the [advices about the submission of a new issue](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
