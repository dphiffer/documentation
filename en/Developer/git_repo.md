# Git Repository:

If you wish to contribute to the project by suggesting new features or by fixing some bugs, please follow the recommendations below regarding the git repository available at [https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag](https://github.com/wallabag/wallabag).

## Current State:

To manage the different versions of Wallabag, we use Git.

There are multiple branches for the source code of the Wallabag web app:

* `master` branch : this is the stable branch, downloaded by those who wish to install Wallabag for their own use.
* `dev` branch : before being added on `master` branch, all bug fixes and new features must go on this branch (i.e : This is where you must send your PRs). This branch is not recommended for production use.
* `v2` branch : this is the branch for a revamp of Wallabag. As of mid-2015, all work is now done here.

## Workflow

All the rules for contributing to the git repository are in the ```CONTRIBUTING.md``` file of Wallabag. Please read this file carefully before making any changes.
