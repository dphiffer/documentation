# Ebook Conversion:

To allow you to read your articles on an e-reader, Wallabag can convert them to multiple formats, and hence create an eBook for your long winter evenings.

The formats currently supported are :

* ePub 3.0
* Mobi
* PDF

  

## A Word of Caution:

Be careful, the creation of ebook files can be very resource demanding for the server on which Wallabag is installed depending on the number of articles and their length.
Do not unnecessarily create large eBooks.

## Where to Convert Articles:

You can convert your articles at various places in Wallabag:

* On the reading page of an article: the ePub link will convert this article only.
* From the list of articles (unread, favorite or archived articles, articles with a tag): a link at the bottom of the page allows you to convert all the article of this category
* From a search: the link is at the bottom of the page.
* From the configuration page: you can convert all your articles, whatever their category.
