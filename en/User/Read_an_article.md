# Reading an Article:

Reading an article is not difficult in Wallabag: click on the title of the article for it to be displayed.

## Returning to an Article:

If an article has been left halfway through, the next time Wallabag returns to the article it will resume from the previous position.

**Note:** This feature only works with web applications and not with smartphone applications.

## Possible Actions in an Article:

The following actions can be performed through the icons displayed at the top of the page. It is assumed that the *baggy* theme is being used. ([Read the documentation about how to change theme](Configure_wallabag.md)). Icons in other themes are very similar.  

Here are the actions, in the order of appearance of the icons.
