# Organizing Articles:

There are several methods available to sort and manage your articles.


## Tags:

### Assigning a tag

#### When saving an article:

To tag an article when saving it, just click on the tag icon next to the URL field before hitting the **Save** button. At the moment, it is possible only to do this from the web interface, but it could come to some apps or extensions.

#### From the article:

To tag an already-saved article, go to the reading page of the article. Find the section which says **Tags** which is indicated with a pencil and click this button.

Enter as many tags that you wish to assign seperated by  **commas**, not spaces. Auto-completion is available here: when you type the first letters of an existing tag, it is not necessary to type the whole word. Select it in the drop-down list. Once all your tags are entered, click  on the button **Tag**.

#### From the search:

A full chapter on the topic of search can be found [here](Search.md). Here, we will describe only how to assign a tag from your search.

When your search displays results, you will find a link `Apply the tag [example] to this search` at the bottom of the page. Click on this to assign the tag to the articles.

### Find all the articles with a given tag:

In the wallabag menu, click on **Tags**. All the tags that have been created will be displayed and sorted by the number of articles for each tag. Click on one of these tags to find all the articles associated with this tag.

## Preferred articles:

Articles can be marked as **Preferred** to be set aside for later.

### Set an article as Favorite:

Articles can be set as **Favorite** from the reading page of an article, or from a list of articles (such as the list of unread articles), simply by clicking the Star.
Clicking the star a second time will remove the **favorite** status of this article.

### Finding all the favorite articles:

In the Wallabag menu, click on **Favorites** to display the list of all the articles that have been set as favorite.

## Archived articles

Articles can be archived after reading to be removed from the list but still be retained in the Wallabag account.

### Archiving an article:

Articles can be archived from the reading page of an article, or from a list of articles (such as the list of unread articles), by clicking on the icon âœ“.  
Clicking on this icon a second time will return the status of the article to **unread**.

### Finding all archived articles:

In the Wallabag menu, click on **Archive** to find all the articles that have been archived.

## Deleting an article:

**Caution:** deleting an article is **definitive**. It will be deleted from the Wallabag database.

To delete an article, a trash icon is displayed on the page of an article or of a list of articles (**unread**, **favorites** or **archived**). Wallabag trusts that you know what you are doing and will not issue a warning message to confirm your selection.
