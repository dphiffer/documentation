# Framabag Account Creation:

If you do not want to install and update Wallabag yourself, or if you do not have the know-how, it is possible to create an account for free at [Framabag.org](https://www.framabag.org).
A brief introduction to Framabag can be found [here](https://framabag.org/cquoi/#/).

## Account Creation

Click on the button **Cr√©ez votre compte / Create your account**.

You will be required to enter some information: 

* A Username 
* A Password 
* An email address. 

Your email address is used only to validate your account, unless you subscribe to the newsletter (3 to 4 messages per year).

Once this form is validated, you will receive an email with the confirmation link. Click on it to validate the creation of your account.

You will receive a last email with the address of your Framabag account, which will look like
`https://www.framabag.org/u/Your-username`.

## Storage of Your Information

Framabag uses one database per user. We do not and will never use the data you provide.

## You have Forgotten your Password

If you have forgotten your password to connect to Framabag, a form is available [on the main page of the service](https://www.framabag.org).  
Fill it, and a confirmation will be sent to your email address which will allow you to enter a new password.

## Account Deletion

If you wish to delete your account, contact us by email: [hello@wallabag.org](mailto:hello@wallabag.org) using the address you created your account with, and state your username. 

We will respond once your account has been deleted. Once this is done, all information will be deleted.
