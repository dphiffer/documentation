# Searching Content in Wallabag

A full search engine is available in Wallabag to allow for easy access and sorting of saved articles.

Click on **Search** in the Wallabag menn and enter the search terms.

Wallabag will go through all articles and list the ones containing the search terms in their title and content.

## Converting search results into ePub format:

Listed articles can be converted to the ePub format, so that they can be read from an e-reader. More information can be found in the [ePub conversion](epub_conversion.md) chapter.

## Assigning a tag to the search results

A tag can be created based on the search criteria. Look at the chapter on [Organizing articles](Organize_articles.md) for more on this topic.
