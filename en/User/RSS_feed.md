# RSS feed

The RSS feed allows:

* reading of articles from a preferred RSS feed reader.
* reading from smartphone software.

First, the RSS feature must be activated by generating a feed token.  
Go to **config** in Wallabag and generate a token in the section **Feeds**.
Tokens can be generated at any time.

## Read articles

Once the token is created, three RSS feeds will be available:

* Unread articles
* Favorites articles
* Archived articles

Add the desired feed to the RSS feed reader.

**Note**: reading an article from the RSS Feed Reader will not set the article status as *Read*

### Sharing feeds:

Article feeds can be shared by sharing the RSS Feed.
Once an article is set as favorite in Wallabag, it will be able to be read by another user.

## Activating the Smartphone Features

RSS Feed Tokens can be used in conjunction with smartphone software. For more information about smartphone sofware, see [Saving Your First Article](Save_your_first_article.md).
